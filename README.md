- Hi, I’m @WarriorMCIII
- I’m interested in Minecraft modding, Java developpement, Game developpement and web coding
- I know coding in JavaScript and HTML, for anything else I'm not good at all (especially in CSS)
- I’m currently learning Java and Minecraft modding, and I plan to learn C++ or C# one day (if I can understand the differences between the two)
- Just made a mobile app ! Not posting it for now because there is my google api key and I still need it so I can't remove it
